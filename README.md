Malware visualization on earth map

## Aim

The aim is to visualize the malwares around the world on an earth map. The map should be working in a dynamic mode so that 
new datas should be visualized on the fly.

## Tools

* Use [kartograph](http://kartograph.org/) to create earth maps. The first resulting visualization should be line the one at [3d projection](http://kartograph.org/showcase/3d/)
* To get the malware information [hpfeeds](https://redmine.honeynet.org/projects/hpfeeds/wiki) will be used. It is a Honeynet project that lets getting malware information updates from a central honeypot. After subscribing to hpfeeds, by using a secure channell the gathered information is as below:

 {"url": "http://78.97.47.218:3334/asinq", "daddr": "10.10.10.10", "saddr": "78.97.47.218", "dport": "445", "sport": "3725", "sha512": "a77687f49dff9baf425048e97931de39fc799efdad759d514bcf359e29106cbd6a6bf5aac5d9130d03f9d5dba352110f623c166c31f6ef7a21557acf6a4aa52b", "md5": "78c9042bbcefd65beaa0d40386da9f89"}

* A web interface is required and better to use a framework like Django. 

## Requirements

* Ability to code with Python and basic understanding of javascript and web development is required
* Django will be used for the frontend issues
