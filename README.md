Malware visualization on earth map

## Aim

The aim is to visualize the malwares around the world on an earth map. The map should be working in a dynamic mode so that 
new datas should be visualized on the fly. 

## Tools

* Use [kartograph](http://kartograph.org/) to create earth maps. The first resulting visualization should be line the one at [3d projection](http://kartograph.org/showcase/3d/)
* To get the malware information [hpfeeds](https://redmine.honeynet.org/projects/hpfeeds/wiki) will be used. It is a Honeynet project that lets getting malware information updates from a central honeypot. After subscribing to hpfeeds, by using a secure channell the gathered information is as below:

 {"url": "http://78.97.47.218:3334/asinq", "daddr": "10.10.10.10", "saddr": "78.97.47.218", "dport": "445", "sport": "3725", "sha512": "a77687f49dff9baf425048e97931de39fc799efdad759d514bcf359e29106cbd6a6bf5aac5d9130d03f9d5dba352110f623c166c31f6ef7a21557acf6a4aa52b", "md5": "78c9042bbcefd65beaa0d40386da9f89"}

* A web interface is required and better to use a framework like Django. 
* The malware information for the past time should be kept for further daata analysis.

## Requirements

* Ability to code with Python and basic understanding of javascript and web development is required
* Django will be used for the frontend issues
* Strong willing to develop a visualization tool that will help security specialists ease life. Check [HoneyMap](http://map.honeynet.org/) Let's develop that is more powerfull. 3D view, dig \& explore the details. HoneyMap is lack of zooming to the details. First milestone of the project include some issues. The second milestone is the zooming to the details part. The issues are not defined yet but will be filled during the application period.

## ToDo

* Check the issues. Prepare a good proposal for the project including your timeline. At your proposal be certan and clear as much as possible. Define your solution. Think about the second mile stone. What kind of feature that can be added to the zoom the details part, like using a malware analyzer to get the details about the malware (VirusTotal or cuckoobox). Think about using the collected data. What type of information can it be gathered for future analysis?
