Malware visualization on earth map
Version: v0.1.a

## Aim
The aim was to provide real time visualization of malware activities with historical data.
Here is a sample demo:

## How to install
* Before installation please make sure that your system has necessary packages installed.
* For Ubuntu:
    sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev libevent-dev libmysqlclient-dev python-virtualenv
* virtualenv env-demo --no-site-packages (tested with version 1.9.1)
* cd env-demo
* source bin/activate
* git clone https://github.com/YakindanEgitim/malwarez.git
* cd malwarez
* git checkout devel
* pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
* open prepareDB.sh and set root username (password will be prompted during execution) also set the variables to create new db & user, such as hostname, database, username & password
* ./prepareDB.sh
* update settings.py with info from prepareDB.sh
* ./manage.py syncdb
* ./run.py &
* ./scripts/hpfeeds/feedReader.py &

## How to run
By default it is running on port 80.
just open localhost on your browser and that's it.

## FAQ
How to change port number of server?
* 2 files should be changed. Both of the following variable values should be same otherwise new events does not shows up.
* run.py: change the value of PORT variable
* scripts/hpfeeds/feedReader.py: change the value of socketIOPort

I added a script but can not find modules although they are installed in virtualenv.
* check the python interpreter line. don not use #!/usr/bin/python which is system's interpreter not the virtual-env's. Use #!/usr/bin/env python
